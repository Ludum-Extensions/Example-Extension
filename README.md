# Example-Extension
Example Extension for Ludum Roblox visual coding using Blockly.

Documentation located inside of `extension.js`, Note that you might find errors when opening the extension with an IDE as a solution on line 1 you can add `let extension = ` before the first curly bracket and it will resolve any errors. Remember to remove that though once uploading the file to github.
