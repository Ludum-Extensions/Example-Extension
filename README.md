# Example-Extension
Example Extension for Ludum Roblox visual coding using Blockly.

A new category is created for every .js file located in the plugin take note of that, so if you wanted to have a tab for a part with 3 different blocks in it you would have one js file with the 3 blocks code inside of it.
